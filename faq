🕹️ What is W3Play?
W3Play is a next-generation Web3 GameHub that empowers developers to launch Unity and Unreal Engine games with built-in Play-to-Earn (P2E) systems. It’s a complete ecosystem offering publishing, funding, rewards, and asset monetization — all in one place.

🎯 What does Play-to-Earn (P2E) mean?
Play-to-Earn (P2E) lets players earn real cryptocurrency by playing games. On W3Play, $W3P tokens are awarded for completing quests, leveling up, and achieving milestones — making gameplay rewarding on every level.

🚀 How do I start earning as a player?
To get started:

Download the W3Play GameHub

Create or connect your crypto wallet

Choose and play an approved game

Earn $W3P tokens automatically as you progress

It's that simple. No crypto experience needed.

💰 What is the $W3P token used for?
$W3P is the utility token of the W3Play ecosystem. You can:

Buy in-game items or upgrades

Stake to earn passive income

Trade or sell on DEXs (after launch)

Fund new game projects

Access exclusive events and content

🔄 Can I trade my earned $W3P tokens?
Yes! Once launched (planned for August 2025), $W3P will be tradeable on major decentralized exchanges. You’ll be able to convert gameplay rewards into real-world value whenever you want.
