The native $W3P token is officially launched with a fully-audited smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring compliance with best practices for security, gas optimization, and upgradeability.

ðŸŒ± Community Groundwork & Organic Awareness Building
Before any public campaigns, the team focuses on building relationships with early supporters via Discord, Telegram, and a developer-focused Twitter presence. Private AMAs and partner briefings take place.

ðŸ”§ Platform Backend Architecture & Admin Panel Setups
Initial dev ops efforts focus on backend frameworks â€” including database architecture, user wallet binding, and security layers for game and asset handling.

ðŸŽ® Core P2E Engine Design & Integration Strategy Planning
The foundational logic of how $W3P will reward players, including anti-bot measures and proof-of-play conditions, is defined in consultation with game economists.

Phase 2 â€” GameHub Beta & First Game Integrations
ðŸš€ W3Play GameHub Beta Goes Public
A web-based portal is opened to select users, offering wallet login, game library previews, and a dashboard for claimable rewards, feedback submissions, and user analytics.

ðŸŽ¯ Launch of 3 In-House Games with Built-In Token Mechanics
W3Play reveals its initial trio of games, designed internally to showcase the full potential of P2E. These include an endless runner, a multiplayer shooter, and a card-based strategy title â€” each with embedded smart contract hooks.

ðŸ”— Live Integration of Smart Contracts for Real-Time Rewards
Games begin to interact with smart contracts for token rewards. Each play session is recorded, validated, and matched with on-chain rewards in real-time using Chainlink oracles for verification.

ðŸ¤ First Third-Party Game Onboarded for Cross-Incentive Testing
A handpicked indie developer integrates their Unity-based game into the W3Play ecosystem. This serves as a pilot program for external devs, testing API documentation, reward logic, and platform scalability.

The long-awaited NFT marketplace opens, allowing players to buy, sell, and trade in-game assets (skins, weapons, power-ups, land). Built on Polygon for lower fees, with cross-chain support in sight.

ðŸ’¼ Tokenization of Game Items & First Revenue-Backed NFTs
Items from W3Playâ€™s games are now tokenized as unique NFTs. Select items come with built-in token yield mechanisms or special access rights, blurring the line between gameplay and investment.

Phase 4 â€” Global Reach, Developer Ecosystem, and Feature Refinement
ðŸ¦ Targeted Listing on Binance or Tier-1 Exchange
Having demonstrated traction, liquidity, and ecosystem health, $W3P sets its sights on a major Tier-1 listing. Due diligence and community-based support drive listing petitions.

ðŸ” Cross-Chain Compatibility & Wallet Integration Upgrades
W3Playâ€™s infrastructure is expanded to support BNB Chain, Arbitrum, and Solana â€” letting players interact with assets and games across different blockchains, with automatic bridging logic built in.
